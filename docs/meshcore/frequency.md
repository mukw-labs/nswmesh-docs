# MeshCore Frequency

Choosing a frequency depends on other repeaters and users in your area. Before deploying a fixed node or repeater, join the <a href={DISCORD_INVITE_URL}>NSW Mesh Discord</a> and ask which profile is currently being used near you.

## Frequency Profiles

| Profile | Frequency | Bandwidth | Spreading Factor | Coding Rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Australia (Mid)** | **915.075 MHz** | **125 kHz** | **9** | **4/5** |
| Australia (Narrow) | 916.575 MHz | 62.5 kHz | 7 | 4/8 |
| Australia (Wide) | 915.800 MHz | 250 kHz | 11 | 4/5 |

## Current NSW Usage

From April/May 2026 onwards, the majority of NSW Mesh users and repeaters migrated to the **Australia Mid** profile.

Prior to this migration, NSW was split between two primary profiles:

- Australia (Wide)
- Australia (Narrow)

Before the introduction of the Narrow and Mid profiles, the NSW mesh primarily operated on the Australia Wide profile. These settings differ slightly from the default Australian MeshCore Australia preset, using a **Spreading Factor of 11 instead of 10**.

There are still some areas within NSW that continue to use the Australia Narrow profile, and the majority of Victoria currently remains on Narrow.

## Recommendation

If you are unsure which profile to use, ask in the <a href={DISCORD_INVITE_URL}>NSW Mesh Discord</a> before configuring your node. Using the same profile as nearby repeaters and users is critical for interoperability and coverage.
